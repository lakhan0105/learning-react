## Birthday Buddy

- I am building this project from John Smilga's React course
- ðŸ”—https://react-vite-projects-1-birthday-buddy.netlify.app/

- It displays the users with their age
- It has a clear all btn which removes all the users from the container
- when you refresh the page the users will appear back

- I will take the data from https://github.com/john-smilga/react-course-v3/blob/main/04-fundamental-projects/01-birthday-buddy/starter/src/data.js
